# todo-project
The odin project todo list project.

Uses the localStorage api to permenently store user data to keep track of the projects and tasks within them.

Using webpack and modules to organise project.

Managed to get localstorage api working and learnt a lot about structuring a project building this.
Could have spent a lot more time improving the styling but all functionality has been added and I am happy with the project in this state
